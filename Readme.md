# Introduction
Hi, my name is Nya and I am a first year master's student in the health data science program.

## About Me
This is my first time in California and I'm very excited to explore the Bay Area.

## Course Goals
I have a deep interest in neuroimaging and neuroscience as a whole. I am particularly enthusiastic about acquiring Python skills, as I believe they will be instrumental in analyzing and identifying significant findings within the field of neuroscience. I look forward to the opportunities that learning Python will open up in this exciting and ever-evolving domain.

## Assignment - Making the Grade
I have completed the [Making the Grade Solution](exercises/1-foundations/exercise.ipynb).

## Challenges Faced
The assignment itself wasn't too difficult. But as a first time user of VSCode and Github, it was difficult to navigate through the steps to successfully submit the assignment.
